# Problem / Solution



## PROBLEM

We've given up on the world in general. People repeatedly and continually are disgusting, disappointing & uncaring.  Whatever the reasons for our seemingly abhorrent social behavior, through the ages it never seems to go away and only changes from one form to another without ever full fully being eradicated.&#x20;

While there are glimmers of hope, i.e. individual cases of great generosity & cohesion, even successful large scale movements for the betterment of man kind, it seems there is something innate in our behavior that craves or causes chaos and discontent -- like a fly that is drawn to dung.&#x20;

While we seek the good and applaud it's successes, all it takes is one bad actor to reek havoc and cause the failure of positive movements like a bull in a china shop, or a single bad apple spoiling the whole bunch.&#x20;

In building a new movement we must take this behavior into consideration as we seriously & carefully build process & systems to prevent or combat against the lowest common denominator amongst ourselves while rewarding and nurturing the positive.

## SOLUTION

The real solution must, and inevitably will, be battle tested and evolve. This means it will be in constant flux to account for the dynamic problems we are solving. The first step of which I believe to be a type of ego death of the individual, allowing the birth of a collective mindset. In essence the transcendance of "me" into "we".&#x20;

Once self-preservation tendencies are incorporated into a collective, we will have sparked a flame that is near impossible to extinguish. This does not mean your individuality will be irrelevant, as there is extreme value in varying perspectives & character traits, however a certain amount of collective thought cohesion is necessary especially as we progress towards collective property asset cohesion taking place.&#x20;

I believe this can be achieved via a community managed code of ethics -- the documents you're reading -- that are **not** obeyed & enforced because an **authority** tell us to, but because they are **innately valued** and **collectively enforced** via decentralized trial membership procedures.&#x20;

Also important is a way of compartmentalizing so if one node becomes dysfunctional or fails it doesn't affect the entire network -- an extension of the "one bad apple" problem. In essence each member becomes law maker, policeman, judge and jury in their respective node's jurisdiction. Regardless of how each node governs itself, we will have to deal with our respective territorial governments and outsiders from which we must build defenses and precautions against. This can be likened unto the shell on the egg that allows the yoke to transcend into the baby chick, a functioning living organism comprised of different yet unified parts.

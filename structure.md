# Structure

In keeping with the imagery our name evokes -- **Suns and Daughters of the Setting Sun** -- we will use the rays and body of the sun to describe our base organizational system.  All organizations are required to maintain a sense of order, this is ours. &#x20;

There is a broad general group that all members originate from and pass through, this is the _SUN_.  The  investigator turns initiate turns member turns mentor turns grandmaster and VOILA! You can now create you're own _RAY._  This essentially means you get to start introducing your own rituals.  _RITUALS?!_  That's right.  No cult would be complete without them, and the group's goal is to get you on the path to essentially starting your own flavor of cult as an extension of ours.  See how that works?

Each ritual signifies the graduation of one level to the next. The progression is as follows:

### **Awaiting Invitation =>**  Sangha Crowdsurf Ritual

This is essentially everyone in the world.  They are people you socialize with, that know you in some way and are prime candidates for initiation.  When you've mentioned the group to someone you know and they seem interested, invite them to our **"Sangha".**  They are now your initiate in training, you are now their mentor. To an outsider this will most closely resemble attending a Potluck BBQ with a friend.  We hold these around new or full moons with the exact day and time codified within our communications.  &#x20;

Once someone desires to become an initiate they attend one of these meetings and embark on a collective crowdsurf passing onto the next level: **the initiate**. \


### Initiate => Peak Pledge Ritual

An initiate is tasked with learning the standards, practices, opportunities and expectations of what **EHB** is about.  In order to internalize how they fit into their own spiritual and temporal progressive path they will prepare:

* I AM Statement + Roadmap
* [Problem / Solution](problem-solution.md) Statement
* $55 Asset Contribution

When they have assembled all these pieces they will be given a pack and hike to the top of a mountain to present their offerings and recite their statements committing to internalize the core values that we share and as such join the ranks as an official member.  When they descend from the mountain they are lavished with a day of spa relaxation and collective recreation to celebrate their birth into **□∆○**.&#x20;



### Member => Recital Ritual

After becoming a member and enjoying the collective assets and experiences shared by the collective for a season they will be invited to take the next step in their progression by demonstrating that the standards and values have been fully integrated.  This will open them up to the experience of being tested by varying members of the group, known as the Kōan System, in order to exemplify that the values are not merely memorized but have permeated through the character of the person, and as such are endowed with even more luxuries such as space in our collective offices and shared equity in our assets.

The Recital Ritual is enacted as a member stands in a square, holding weights in their right and left hand.  They hold these as they recite their I AM statement aloud, answer questions from current Grand Masters and&#x20;

* Kōan Creation
* 1 [Core Value](core-values/) Contribution
* $1,234 Asset Contribution



### Grand Master =>  Radiating Ray Ritual

At this level you can administer the preceding rituals and assemblies, having gone through them yourself.  You are expected to enforce that new initiates and members are living up to the group's standards and encouraged to continue to shape and ammend the culture as you see fit.  We depend on your watchful eye to ensure the culture stays nurturing and beneficial for all.  If and when you want to take a specific practice, activity or mindset to the next level that might be daunting or unneccessary for other members you are invited to create your own RAY so to speak.  This means inviting and allowing other members to participate in extra practices that augment what we do as a general collective.  For instance practicing long or intensive bouts of meditation & yoga or practicing telepathy and lucid dreaming or other tantric arts could fit into this category.  The ritual is of your choosing and design.

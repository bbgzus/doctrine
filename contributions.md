# Contributions

This whole project hinges upon the idea that a group of people can manage themselves and upkeep our practices & documentation.  Doing so will allow our individual ideas and insights to be added to the communities' and prevent the occurrence of what is known as [The Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy\_of\_the\_commons).

While not required, it is recommended that members contribute via an anonymous persona. We could write an entire section on why [anonymity is important](https://epic.org/issues/democracy-free-speech/anonymity/), which we probably will at some point in the future, but for now just know that we believe [it is in the best interest](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall95-papers/rigby-anonymity.html) of the group & the individual.

So go ahead and grab yourself a [new email](https://proton.me/mail) not tied to your government issued identity and contact me at [iambbgzus@gmail.com](https://app.gitbook.com/u/6RRXWckItVSXvYJap4IakwE79FI3) to begin your initiation, young grasshopper 🥋 🙇🏼 🥷🏻

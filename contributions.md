Remember anonymity is key 🔐 So join with an account that is not associated with your personal identity 🕵🏻‍♂️  After you have finished your contribution, submit your proposal and it will be reviewed by the members and voted on.&#x20;

We could write an entire section on why [anonymity is important](https://epic.org/issues/democracy-free-speech/anonymity/), which we probably will at some point in the future, but for now just know that we believe [it is in the best interest](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall95-papers/rigby-anonymity.html) of the group & the individual as we strive for meritocracy over political maneuvering & influence.

This whole project hinges upon the idea that a group of people can manage themselves and upkeep our practices & documentation.  It is important because it will deter our organization from become stale and fill loopholes that inevitably will be found so as to avoid the [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy\_of\_the\_commons).

If you're wanting to get involved more deeply, for example being on the review board for this documentation, go ahead and grab yourself a [new anonymous email](https://proton.me/mail) and contact me at[ iambbgzus@gmail.com ](mailto:iambbgzus@gmail.com)to begin your initiation, young grasshopper.&#x20;

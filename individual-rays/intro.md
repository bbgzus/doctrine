# Intro

Members are encouraged to form collective groups that fit their desires and needs.  The larger organization cannot support and oversee all such groups so we have created a system to empower decentralization.  We covered this briefly in our [Membership](../membership.md) section.

One must become a Grand Master in order to initiate their Ray.  Principals flow out from the sun to it's rays, hence principals in the individual rays do not reflect the values of the central sun.  Of course there will always be a relation, but as long as rays behave in accordance to our agreed upon [Core Values](../core-values/) then they are free to expand in whatever direction they choose, be that east or west.

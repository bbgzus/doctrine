# Long-Form Manifest

This is an experiment to combine new societal & financial structures to empower humans to reach unprecedented levels of self realization & creative expression.  It has 3 principal pillars.

> ● Open and adaptable collection of core community values. This will empower a form of community governance that is designed for active participants rather than apathetic followers.  If you don't like the rules, help change them.
>
> \
> ▲  Physical Spaces that can profit from being collectively owned and developed.  Most importantly these can provide for the housing and financial needs of the group.
>
> \
> ■ Empower member to reach their highest potential via creative, spiritual, economic or whatever avenue that looks like for you.&#x20;

What follows is intended to help you understand the principal, progress & procedures of our vision, but that is is not constrained by.  This is a living document, nothing is "set in stone".  We value the traight of being too elusive to truly grasp, a wordless teaching rooted in the enduring gentle motion of nature.  An inner power that knows no bounds, no expectation of desire and thus is free to adapt.  Each experience adding strand upon strand to the ineffable whole.

One will inevitably ask, as I have one many times, "Why am I doing this?".  By "this" I mean putting the time into a community development turned spiritual adjacent project rather than getting a comfy 6 figure salary, endlessly traveling around the globe or just drinking Mai Tais on the beach somewhere.  Sure those all sound good on paper, but the truth is simply

> I can't stop thinking about it

I intend this to be an artistic expression, a type of Magnum Opus if you will, that when properly executed will actually fuel a lifestyle that not only satisfies all money and career aspirations, but will be our "dent in the universe" as the late Jobs would say in fulfilling ones dharma and laying the groundwork to transform all of human life - or at least seed groups with new societal reform comparable to historical epochs such as the end of slavery, the industrial revolution or the renaissance. &#x20;

As part of this transformation it will provide solutions to end involuntary homelessness, elderly care, higher education, universal basic income and effect global currency markets in the trillions of dollars -- that is, if it is executed correctly.

At the very least if it only changes one individual's life (mine or yours) for the better it will have been worth it.  I don't expect these results to happen overnight or without considerable work and dedication.  In order to fully realize the vision it will take a lot of dominoes falling into place in a way, most likely only in a way that God could arrange.

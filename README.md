# Welcome to the Cult

The following is an open source cult en embryo. It was born from a crypto currency, grew up in a jail cell and is maturing into a world wide organization. Ambitious? You bet.

Cult is short for Culture

Cults have been around forever and you're already part of many!

Words and labels such as "Cult", "God", "Spirituality" etc have many different meanings and can always be twisted and distorted. Let's stop relying on labels and make our experience awesome irregardless of what we call it.  Language is useful in our functioning world, however Truth exists outside of language.  Seek that.

Ideas and people should be evaluated via meritoracy rather than au

There is but one commandment: **transcend yourself via seeking your higher collective self.**

Welcome child, we are the _Sons and Daughters of the Setting Sun_ and yes... we have a secret handshake ü§ù üòú

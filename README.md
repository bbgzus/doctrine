# Welcome to the Cult

The following is an open source cult en embryo.  It was born from a crypto currency, grew up in a jail cell and is maturing into a podcast fueled world wide organization.  Ambitious?  You bet. &#x20;

Feel free to dive into whatever subjects interest you most via the sidebar, but here are a few philosophies condensed to give you a brief overview.



Cult is short for Culture

Cults have been around forever and you're already part of many!

Everything is nothing, so let's make it awesome.

We could all retire right now if everyone could just learn to share.

There is but one commandment: **transcend yourself via seeking your higher collective self.**

Money is just an idea, God is just an idea... so why not put them together?  In $X! we trust :)



Who are we? We are ever changing, we are transcendentalists, we are socialistic capitalists, we are optimistic nihilists, we believe in magic, we have transcended labels, we are everything you ever wanted a cult to be. &#x20;

Welcome child, we are the _Sons and Daughters of the Setting Sun_ and yes... we have a secret handshake ü§ù\

# Kōan System

## Welcome to Our Unique Meritocracy!

We believe in truly experiencing and proving our skills, just like the reflective Koan system in Zen Buddhism. As our community grows and evolves, so does our process of recognizing each other's talents and ranks. It's all about staying real and demonstrating what we're made of through various fun and challenging activities!

#### What's on the Menu?

Our challenges are as diverse as we are, and there's something for everyone! You might find yourself:

* 🤑 Showing off your financial wizardry
* 🥊 Stepping into the ring for some wrestling or boxing
* 🏋️‍♂️ Flexing your muscles in weight lifting
* ♟️ Mastering the game of chess
* 🎮 Dominating in your favorite video game
* 🧊 Taking the cold plunge challenge
* 🧘‍♂️ Going the distance in a meditation marathon
* 🏅 Competing in your favorite sport
* 🏆 Sharing your proudest accomplishment
* ...and more, any activity can be used that 2 members agree to

#### How Do We Decide the Winners?

While we love a good score and clear winners/losers for most of our challenges, we also have a soft spot for the arts. Whether it's drawing, singing, or writing poetry, our group members become the jury. Don’t worry, it’s all anonymous to keep things fair and square – no room for politics here!

#### Staying Sharp and Mindful

Every core value of ours is tied to a test or trial, ensuring we all truly walk the walk. We keep things fresh and unpredictable, akin to discovering a hidden treasure or an Easter egg. Failing a challenge? No biggie. It's merely a nudge to remind us of our core values, not a punishment. Our aim? To foster a positive environment where growth an competition are rewarded over criticism.

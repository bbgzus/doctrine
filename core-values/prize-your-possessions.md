# Prize Your Possessions

In the grand tapestry of life, our roles as stewards of what we possess define not only our material success but our personal growth and the impact we create on those around us. Stewardship extends far beyond the mere management of financial assets or physical possessions; it encompasses the guardianship of our mind, spirit, and the virtues we hold dear, such as honor. The true measure of leadership and influence, therefore, is rooted in the depth of self-governance we practice.

### The Essence of Stewardship

Being a good steward means nurturing, protecting, and thoughtfully enhancing every aspect of our lives, be it tangible or intangible. This includes:

* **Material Possessions**: Treating them with care and respect, understanding their value and utility, and ensuring they are maintained properly.
* **Mind and Spirit**: Cultivating a positive mindset, continuous learning, emotional intelligence, and spiritual wellness.
* **Honor and Values**: Upholding and living by oneâ€™s values, ensuring actions taken are reflective of the principles considered sacred.

The effectiveness with which we can lead and manage others, whether in personal or professional domains, is directly proportionate to how well we can manage ourselves.  To elevate the standard of stewardship in our lives, we must:

1. **Set High Standards**: Develop and adhere to high standards that challenge us to improve continuously.
2. **Extension of Standards**: Ensure these standards are consistently applied not only to our behavior but in how we allow others to interact with our possessions or personal boundaries.
3. **Acknowledgment**: Recognize and celebrate when others around us uphold these standards, reinforcing a culture of excellence.

### Establishing Boundaries

It is also crucial to identify and set solid boundaries, especially with those who may not respect or understand the value of what we entrust them with. The adage of casting "pearls before swine" serves as a poignant reminder that not everything of value we possess will be appreciated or used wisely by others. Discerning when and with whom to share our resources, knowledge, or time protects these assets from being undervalued or wasted.

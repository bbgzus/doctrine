# Intuition, Logic & Emotion

### The Heart's Role in Decision Making

The heart plays a crucial role in our decision-making processes, communicating intuitive insights to the brain. This process is frequently mistaken for telepathic communication, underscoring the intricate interplay between the mind and body. Such insights reveal how a heart-centered understanding can clarify situations that purely intellectual communication cannot.

### Knowing vs. Seeing

Distinguishing between knowing and seeing involves understanding how our hearts interpret truth through the brain's filters. Our viewpoints are a mixture of personal experiences and shared realities. Yet, the reliability of our sight may be compromised by the mind's propensity to interpret visual information based on emotional and subjective biases, leading us to sometimes see what we expect or desire, rather than what is.

### Telepathy and Intuition

Telepathy, sometimes misconstrued as a dialogue between the mind and mind — whether within oneself or across individuals—reveals little difference until one engages heart-to-heart. Such a connection enables the deciphering of messages through divine intuition. Communication can become muddled when one attempts to connect mind-to-mind or when listening to another's thoughts with one's heart. True understanding and connection arise from a mutual exchange—engaging with empathy and listening intently with heart and mind.&#x20;

Recent scientific investigations into phenomena traditionally considered outside the scope of empirical study have led to significant insights, urging a reassessment of the criteria for evidence. The concept of intuitive truths, which resonate on a profound level and validate themselves much like a self-affirming truth, has emerged as a fascinating area of study.

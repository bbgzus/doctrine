# Core Values

We believe in a dynamic set of principles that draw from the wisdom found across various religious traditions. By aligning your thoughts and actions with these principles, you can elevate your vibrational energy. This, in turn, allows you to become a conduit of light and greatness that is your best self.

Our guidelines are designed to be adaptable. We understand that discrepancies might occur between someone's behavior and these standards. _**It's crucial to address and rectify such inconsistencies.**_ This may involve either adjusting the individual's behavior or revisiting the value in question. We encourage open dialogue - whether you aim to challenge, clarify, or broaden these principles, your input is not only welcome but essential so [please contribute](../contributions.md) ‚úçüèª  As such our standing attempts to define them are:

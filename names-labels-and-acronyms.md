# Names & Labels

We transcend the need to be defined and identify by any single label and/or name, yet many are helpful when attempting to communicate with our fellow humans -- so if we must be called something, we will often refer to ourselves in the following ways:



**S\&DSS:** Sons & Daughters of the Setting Sun

**EHB:** Eka HlƒÅda Bodhaka ( ‡§è‡§ï ‡§π‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§¨‡•ã‡§ß‡§ï )

**‚ñ°‚àÜ‚óã:**  Square Triangle Circle

**TC:** Transcendentalist Cult



These all have slightly different connotations, yet all mean the same thing.  For example when someone says Tree, Branches, Forest or Evergreen they could all be referring to the same thing, just with different perspectives or at different stages.  Thus it is with us.

Call us whatever you'd like, just don't call us late for dinner üç≤
